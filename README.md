# Bubble Game

Bubble Game is a fun and interactive web game where the player has to find a target number from 25 bubbles within 15 seconds. The goal is to click on the correct number within the time limit, earning points for the correct answer and losing points for wrong clicks. The game offers 3 rounds to test the player's speed and accuracy. Key features of the game include displaying a target number, a timer of 15 seconds, and shuffling the numbers after each click to keep the gameplay fresh. Scoring is based on correct and incorrect clicks, with +10 points for correct clicks and -5 points for incorrect ones. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
